    <h1>Module 1 Comprehensive Learning Journal</h1>
    <h2>Foundations of Instructional Design</h2>

    <p><strong>Date: October 5, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>This module taught me that <strong>Instructional Design (ID)</strong> is much bigger than I first thought. I used to think ID was mainly about making training materials look nice, but now I know it's a deep, professional method for solving problems.</p>

    <h3>1. What This Means for Me and the World</h3>

    <h4>a. For Me (As a Future ID and Learner)</h4>
    <p>The main takeaway is that my job isn't to create "fun" content; it's to solve a <strong>performance problem</strong>. The ID field has become focused on **business and corporate needs** (Raible, 2020). This means I need to stop thinking like a writer and start thinking like a consultant. My success depends on **collaboration** with experts and checking if the training actually helps the company (Martin & Ritzhaupt, 2020).</p>

    <h4>b. For the ID Field</h4>
    <p>The field gets its strength from being **systematic**. Using the **ADDIE framework** (Analysis, Design, Development, etc.) shows that ID uses scientific knowledge to design learning (Schott & Seel, 2015). This helps ID move beyond being just an "education" job and prove its value by delivering a good **Return on Investment (ROI)**.</p>

    <h4>c. For Society</h4>
    <p>ID is always changing because of big events. The first real push for systematic training came from the need for **quick, mass training during World War II** (Molenda, 2023). Today, new **technology and media** are constantly forcing ID to adapt to new platforms, like online learning and apps, keeping the discipline relevant.</p>

    <h3>2. Thinking About My Old Ideas</h3>

    <p>Before this class, I mostly believed ID was about being good at development software. This idea came from seeing many job ads that only listed technical tools.</p>

    <p><strong>My New View:</strong> I was wrong. The module showed me that the most important step is **Analysis**—figuring out <em>why</em> a performance problem exists before designing anything (Schott & Seel, 2015). Focusing only on software meant I was missing the most valuable part: **diagnostic work**. I need to let go of the idea that technical skills are everything and start valuing **critical thinking and communication** more.</p>

    <h3>3. How This Learning Changes Me</h3>

    <h4>a. My Growth</h4>
    <p>I am moving from having a **"developer mindset"** to a **"consultant mindset."** I see myself as someone who solves organizational problems through structured learning, not just someone who designs slides.</p>

    <h4>b. Shift in Perspective</h4>
    <p>My measure of success has changed. I used to ask, "Did the learner like the course?" Now I know I must ask, <strong>"Did the learner's performance improve and meet the business goal?"</strong></p>

    <h4>c. Changes in Behavior</h4>
    <p>I will change how I start a project. Instead of talking about content right away, I will now spend most of my time asking tough questions to identify the **performance gap** first, making sure I am not creating training when another solution (like better tools or motivation) is needed.</p>

    <h3>4. Evaluating My Work</h3>

    <p>I think my performance in this first module was good. I grasped the main ideas quickly and successfully showed how the history, theory, and professional skills all fit together in my concept map and reflection. My best decision was making sure I linked everything back to the business's need for **ROI** (Raible, 2020).</p>

    <h3>5. My Plan for Next Time</h3>

    <p>My main goal is to get better at **Performance Analysis**.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Action (Professional):</strong> I will practice describing training as a solution to a **performance gap** so I can talk the language of business leaders.</li>
        <li><strong>Action (Behavioral):</strong> I will work on my **listening skills** to get better at **collaborating** and interviewing Subject-Matter Experts (Martin & Ritzhaupt, 2020). This will help me find the real root of a performance problem.</li>
    </ul>
